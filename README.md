# Automatic-Gender-Recognition-from-an-audio-file-

The main objective of the project is to classify the gender of the speaker from short audio files using speech processing techniques and deep learning techniques. 

Classification is performed by processing and analysing spectrograms generated from voice recordings.

The steps we have followed for the elaboration of this one start from data collection, signal pre-processing to implementation, tuning and evaluation of machine learning models and analysis of results.
